Full Stack Framework with Django Milestone Project


This is an Ecommerce website built with Python, Django as a pythonâ€™s framework from Code Institute.
E-go is a fictitious e-commerce website that provides holidays packages for users who want to buy this service to go on holidays. 
The website will provide the price and more details for different places to go, cultural aspects and curiosities about different coutries as well.

This project has incorporated code pulled from other projects given by Code Institute:

1. django-e-commerce project
2. django-auth

The course of Code Institute guided me durnig this project.

This site is for any user interested in going on holidays, looking for a single site where you can find a package with hotels, experiences, curiosities about different
countries in just one web page.

E-commerce is only online at the moment, depending on customers' wishes, a special web application can be designed to have in a store.
A super user was created to add the products (packages) and the user can also register to send the payment.

As a new user of the webpage, I'd like to be able to:
- Find out what I can get to know on this website.
On the landing page the user can already see the e-commerce with all the products (packages) he is able to buy.

- Get to know more about travelling from different people. 
The user is able to check the session "Discover" and hear from different people their stories. On this session the user get the links of many blogs regarding travelling.

- If the user still doesnt know about where to go, they can check curiosities about places that the website is selling the packge to, such as Brazil, New Zealand and Thailand.
On the session "curiosities" the user will get to know some fun and interesting things about some places thar the website is selling the package to.

- The user is able to register themself in order to purchase some thing from the webpage.
The user will have to fill a form in order to do it.

- The user is able to choose packages of holidays and get to see it before finishing the order.
When the products are in the cart, the user can amend the order, deleting or adding a new product.

### Strategy 
E-go is a simple web ecommerce to make peoples lives eaiser regarding travelling. On the webpage they can get to know more about travelling through the blogs and also curiosities from diffenrent places.
The owner can negotiate with travel agencies and have more products on the webpage which can be really profitable for both.

### Scope
I wanted from the begging have a webpage easy to access from the user's side, and fun to get to know different blogs. On the navbar there are only 3 options being "Home" where the ecommerce is hoted,
"Curiosities" thar provides interesting stories and facts about places being sold on the ecommerce and "Discover" where users can access many Blogs that post things about trips, travelling and etc.

### Structure
The user who arrives at the main page can see a navigation bar at the top with the session they have access to on the left side and on the right side a Login area.
After the user is re-certified on the website, he can buy any product. To register, the user must provide a username, password and email for the Login. If the user forgets the password, they can access "Reset password" and receive
an email to have a new password. In both cases, a feedback message will be displayed.

The user can simply add the quantity of the packaging to the cart, by clicking on the blank field of the cart with the product he wants, and adding a number (people) to it and then clicking on "add".
The user is redirected to the main page again, giving the opportunity to add another product (package). If this is not the case, the user can access the "cart" at the top right of the navigation bar and be redirected to the checkout session.

OAfter the order is in accordance with what the user has chosen, click on "checkout" and add the necessary payment details, the order will be processed by bands. If there is something to change, the user can change the quantity in the respective field and click on "change".
If the user wants to delete the item, just type "0" in the field and "change" right after, and the product will be deleted.

In both scenarios, payment processed successfully or not, a feedback message will be displayed to the user. If the payment is processed, the user will be redirected to the main page again.

In the Discover section, the user can click on the Blogs most interesting to you and another tab will open in the browser to ensure that the user does not lose control and stay away from the web page.

In the "Curiosities" section, Jumbotrons with images and text with curiosities about different countries.

### Wireframes
Here are the 3 wireframes for each section of my project:

![Scheme](https://ecommercego.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static/wireframes/databsae+schema.png)

## Installation
To be able to create the app the folowing steps were taken:

1. Start with gitpod full template and install Django with the following comand: pip3 install django==1.11.24

2. Create a project with django: django-admin startproject ecommerce

3. Download this project by cliking the [link](https://github.com/Pauloa90/e-commerce)

4. Create env.py and .gitignore to keep your secret keys safe.

5. Set up a Strip account and keep the secret key safe on .gitignore

6. Create an Amazon account and crate a bucket to store your media on S3 services provided by amazon.

7. Type on the terminal "python manage.py migrate" to apply migrations to your local sqlite database.

8. "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" will create a user able to add files to the database or create a new database.

9. To run the project type on terminal "python3 manage.py runserver".



## Deployment
### Amazon 
I created an Amazon account in order to user the service called S3. S3 is a cloud based service tha AWS provides to storage any media or static file for my project. After creating the account, I created a bucket with a name realted to my project.
In this case called "ecommercego". After created the bucket, I went to properties to make it able to hot the static file and media from my project.  
Then I created a policy and a user in Amazon, using the service called IAM(identity and Access Management). 
Those were necessary to manage which user is allowed to change and change the buckets propertie.
Then we go on CORS configurations and prefilled with a default code config. Going on the created bucket policy and attaching the policy to the bucket, it will allow the our account to accsess all the content across all web.
Going again on IAM, we createad a group and set the policies to all. That will create a file that must to be kept safely with the ID and Key to have access to the policy.

When all this is set, we install Boto3, that will allow the storaging on S3. Go to installed apps and add Django Storages.

Once that everything is fine run "python3 manage.py collectstatic" and confirm when asked "yes" to collect all files from our project and host them into S3.

In order to deploy this project a python package Gunicorn was installed and Heroku is the hoster of this project.

### Heroku
Heroku is the service the we are using to host our website. It is synced to the master branch of the Git repository.

In order to deploy please go through the following steps:
- Log in into Heroku and create a "New app".
- Choose a name for you app and region to be hosted and click on "create app"
- Click on "config Vars" once that you select your app just created and set all the variable in Heroku. You can check your env.py where the secret keys are.
- Create the requirements.txt file with all the libraries installed to make your app run typing: pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.
- Create  Profcile typing: echo web: gunicron < NAME OF YOUR PROJECT >.wsgi:application > Profcile
- On Heroku's settings copy http://< app_name.herokuapp.com >
- On the tab "Deploy" find the method of deployment "GitHub" selecting the project your Git Hub account.
- Click on "Deploy" and your project will be hosted by Heroku once the build is complete.
- Once that all is done go to "Open app" to check your project.
